# Name Normalization Resources

This document summarizes options for augmenting the handcrafted `nicknames_common.json` and `suffixes.json` datasets.

## Nicknames

| Source | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| [`joshfraser/nicknames`](https://github.com/joshfraser/nicknames) | MIT-licensed JSON and CSV nickname mappings covering hundreds of common English diminutives. Easy to import as a drop-in replacement or merge with existing mappings. |
| [`censusname/nickname_lookup`](https://github.com/censusname/nickname_lookup) | Includes SSA nickname crosswalk with frequency metadata. Could allow weighting, but requires light parsing to extract mappings. |
| [`openvenues/libpostal`](https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal/tree/master/resources/dictionaries) | Contains broader lexical dictionaries, including nickname-like expansions, but bundled with other locale data. Useful if we want international coverage but heavier dependency. |
| [`probablepeople`](https://github.com/datamade/probablepeople) | Python library for parsing names that ships with curated nickname tables inside its data files. Can be vendored if we prefer Python data structures over raw JSON. |

These sources can be vendored or referenced at build time to pre-generate a richer nickname table. Because they are open-source and versioned, we can periodically re-run an ingestion script instead of manually appending entries.

## Suffixes / Name Affixes

| Source | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| [`probablepeople`](https://github.com/datamade/probablepeople/blob/master/probablepeople/data/constants.py) | Maintains extensive enumerations of suffixes (e.g., *Jr.*, *Sr.*, *III*), prefixes, and other honorifics. Licensed under the GPLv3, so we would need to vendor only the data or keep a compatible license. |
| [`nameparser`](https://github.com/derek73/python-nameparser/blob/master/src/nameparser/config/prefixes.py) | BSD-licensed dataset of honorifics and suffixes. The suffix list is more comprehensive than our current JSON and easy to serialize. |
| [`usaddress`](https://github.com/datamade/usaddress)`'s` lexical data | Contains numerous personal-name tokens, including generational suffixes, though not as directly consumable. |

For suffixes, importing a vetted list from `nameparser` or `probablepeople` would eliminate manual upkeep.

## Recommendation

Adopting one of the open datasets (for example, vendoring the `joshfraser/nicknames` JSON and the `nameparser` suffix list) gives us comprehensive coverage with minimal ongoing maintenance. We can still keep local overrides for sports-specific spellings, but versioning the upstream data keeps updates straightforward. Until we wire up an ingestion step, it is reasonable to append entries as we encounter themâ€”just document the source so that we can reconcile with the upstream dataset later.
